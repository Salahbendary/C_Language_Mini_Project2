# ATmega16 Stop-Watch System with Multiplexed 7-Segment Display

## Project Specifications

1. **Microcontroller:** ATmega16
2. **Microcontroller Frequency:** 1MHz
3. **Timer Configuration:** Timer1 with CTC Mode
4. **Display:** Six Common Anode 7-Segment Displays
5. **Multiplexing:** Utilizing 7447 Decoder and NPN BJT Transistors
6. **Control Pins:** First 4 pins of PORTC for 7447 Decoder, First 6 pins of PORTA for Enable/Disable
7. **Startup:** Stop Watch counting starts upon connecting power to the MCU
8. **External Interrupt INT0:** Falling edge detection to reset the Stop Watch time
9. **External Interrupt INT1:** Rising edge detection to pause the Stop Watch time
10. **External Interrupt INT2:** Falling edge detection to resume the Stop Watch time


## Code Overview

The main code file for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Salahbendary/Stop-Watch-System/blob/main/MiniProject2SalahKhaled/MiniProject2SalahKhaled/MiniProject2SalahKhaled.c). This C code is responsible for configuring the ATmega16 microcontroller, setting up Timer1 in CTC mode, configuring external interrupts, and implementing the stop-watch logic.


## Usage

Follow these steps to use the stop-watch system:
1. Upload the provided code to the ATmega16 microcontroller using a suitable programmer.
2. Set up the hardware components as per the instructions in the hardware setup guide.
3. Power on the circuit to start the stop-watch counting automatically.
4. Use the push-buttons connected to INT0, INT1, and INT2 to control the stop-watch:
   - Pressing the INT0 button (falling edge) will reset the stop-watch time.
   - Pressing the INT1 button (rising edge) will pause the stop-watch time.
   - Pressing the INT2 button (falling edge) will resume the stop-watch time.
