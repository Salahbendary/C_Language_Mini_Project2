# C_Language_Mini_Project2
 implement stop watch system on ATmega16 Microcontroller with specific requirements such as: a specific frequency, Timer1 with compare mode "CTC Mode", using six common anode 7-Segment and connecting it using multiplexed technique. Using one 7447 decoder for all 7-segments and control the enable/disable by using NPN BJT Transistor, configure External Interrupt INT0 with falling edge, connect a push-button with internal pull-up resistor. configure External Interrupt INT1 with raising edge, connect a push-button with external pull-down resistor, configure External Interrupt INT2 with falling edge, connect a push-button with internal pull-up resistor to do some specific configuration such as: reset, pause and resume the counter.
